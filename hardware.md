# Hardware Information

You will require a Raspberry Pi Camera Module connected to your Raspberry Pi. See the [Raspberry Pi Camera Guide](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/camera-module-setup/) to connect your camera to your Raspberry Pi. Then follow the tutorial to enable the camera, test it, and download the `picamera` library.

Next, you will need an Explorer HAT board attached to the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi (with the camera already attached underneath). See the [software section](software.md) to learn how to download the `explorerhat` library.

Phew! That is a fair bit of setup, but it will be worth it in the end.
