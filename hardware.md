# Hardware Information

You will require a Raspberry Pi camera module connected to your Raspberry Pi. See the [Raspberry Pi Camera Guide](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/camera-module-setup/) to connect your camera to your Raspberry Pi. Then follow the [Raspberry Pi Camera Setup Tutorial](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/python-picamera-setup/) to enable the camera, test it, and download the `picamera` library.

Next, you will need a Pibrella board attached to the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi. See the [Pibrella](http://pibrella.com/#setup) guide to learn how to add the board and download the `pibrella` library.

Phew! That is a fair bit of setup, but it will be worth it in the end.
