## Challenge: 

You should now have a completed project. When the wheel turns, the lights should start flashing, the camera should start recording and music should start playing.


Here's some ideas for further improvements you could make to the project:

1. Your hamster might get a little board of the same song plaing every time. Could you add some code so it chooses a random song from a list of songs?
1. Can you add more LEDs to the project, and maybe have them attached to the hamster's cage rather than stuck in a breadboard.
1. How about adding some weird effects to the video - you can find a list of available effects in the documentation - [picamera.readthedocs.io](https://picamera.readthedocs.io)
