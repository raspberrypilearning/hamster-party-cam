## Challenge: build a better disco

You should now have a completed project! When the wheel turns, the lights should start flashing, the camera should start recording, and music should start playing.

Here are some ideas for further improvements you could make to your project:

1. Your hamster might get a little bored of the same song playing every time. Can you add some code to choose a random song from a list of songs and play that?
1. Can you add more LEDs to the project, and maybe have them attached to the hamster's cage rather than stuck in a breadboard?
1. How about adding some weird effects to the videos? You can find a list of available effects for `picamera` [here](https://picamera.readthedocs.io).
