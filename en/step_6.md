## Get the party started with lights

While your hamster is wide awake, you can use the LEDs to create a little disco for it.

- First, beneath where you have created all your LED objects, create a list containing all the LEDs.

```python
lights = [green, red, yellow, blue]
```

In the disco function you want to write some code that will randomly choose an LED and turn it on, then wait for a quarter of a second and then turn a random light off.
